# Summer 2021 Digital Humanities Digital Scholarship Workshop
This site will hold the program, resources and course materials for the 2021 CDS Summer Workshop. The basic structure should have sections for

* Introduction
* Overall Schedule
* Eventually, we'll put in a page for each day. (that will be 7 pages, including Day 0, setup day)
* Not sure what else at the moment

Setting it up so that the blank pages are there, and a footer/header would be great.
