The Library's [Center for Digital Scholarship (CDS)](http://cds.library.brown.edu) is offering an introductory summer program for graduate students in the Humanities and adjacent Social Sciences on digital humanities tools and concepts that bolster digital work.

In addition, the workshop will include readings and discussion on the practice of Digital Humanities, topics like sustainability, data management, and documentation, and will provide an opportunity to explore the digital dimensions of participants’ research projects.

## Upon completing this program, participants will:

- be familiar with a variety of digital methods, the ramifications of applying digital methods and working with digital cultural and historical data
- have a familiarity with existing digital humanities projects (and have criteria for evaluating them)
- be familiar with DH as a disciplinary domain
- be able to plan their own digital project

## Schedule and format

The course will be remote and partly asynchronous, and take place over two weeks.

**You will be expected to attend in-person 3 days a week, from 11:00 am - 12:30 pm and 1:00 - 3:30 pm (EDT).**

Between live classes, participants will complete readings, view videos, and do homework which will incorporate the skills and tools that are presented in the meetings.

Over the second week of the workshop, participants will prepare a small digital project and present it to the class on the last day. There will be opportunities for discussions arising out of participants’ interests.
