# Summer 2021 Digital Humanities Digital Scholarship (DHDS) Workshop

The Library's [Center for Digital Scholarship (CDS)](http://cds.library.brown.edu) is offering an introductory summer program for graduate students in the Humanities and adjacent Social Sciences on digital humanities tools and concepts that bolster digital work. 

In addition, the workshop will include readings and discussion on the practice of Digital Humanities, topics like sustainability, data management, and documentation, and will provide an opportunity to explore the digital dimensions of participantsâ€™ research projects.

Upon completing this program, participants will:

* be familiar with a variety of digital methods, the ramifications of applying digital methods and working with digital cultural and historical data
* have a familiarity with existing digital humanities projects (and have criteria for evaluating them)
* be familiar with DH as a disciplinary domain
* be able to plan their own digital project

This site will hold the program, resources and course materials for the 2021 CDS Summer Workshop. The basic structure should have sections for

* Introduction
* Overall Schedule
* Eventually, we'll put in a page for each day. (that will be 7 pages, including Day 0, setup day)
* Not sure what else at the moment

Setting it up so that the blank pages are there, and a footer/header would be great.
