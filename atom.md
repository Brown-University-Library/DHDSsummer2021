# Introduction to the Atom Text Editor

## What is it?

A text editor is an application that can create and edit text files. Unlike Microsoft Word and other word processors, it doesn't support formatting such as bold, headings, footnotes and other layout features. Instead, it has features that facilitate writing code and manipulating text. You can use it to insert codes that allow text to be formatted — for example, HTML or MarkDown.

Macs and Windows machines have a native applicataion that approximates a text editor: NotePad and TextEdit. These are not as full-featured as Microsoft Word, but they are able to display formatted text, unless plain text (text-only) is specified as an output format. They can be used to edit text files if necessary, but there is a risk that the file will be saved in a binary (formatted) format. They also do not have all the features of an editor like Atom.

Atom can be customized and serve as a very sophisticated (and complex) environment for writing programs. For our purposes, however, we will focus on managing groups of files, exploring them and modifying them using regular expressions.

Atom is one of a several text editors used for writing programs. It open source and runs on Windows, Mac OS and Linux, so everyone in the workshop can work with the same software. Two other popular open source editors that run on all three operating systems are [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). All three have very similar capabilities - your choice is a matter of personal preference.

## Working with Atom
* Install Atom by following the instructions in the [Atom documentation](https://flight-manual.atom.io/). Note that the documentation pages detect the type of operating system you are using and provide appropriate instructions and keyboard shortcuts.
* Download [the zip archive with sample files](), and unzip it. Make sure to remove it from your Downloads folder and store it in an easily accessible location such as your Desktop. These are the files we will use to learn Atom and also to practice regular expressions.
* Open the Atom application by clicking on it.
    * Review *settings* and *packages*.
    * *Install packages* `sort-lines` and `duplicate-removal`.
    * Note the tabs at the top of the window. Also the way files, settings open as side by side panes.
* Open a folder and view it as a project.  Open one or more files.
* Parenthesis matching and completion. HTML completion. Markdown highlighting. This may not be instantly useful, but it demonstrates the kind of thing that text editors are good at.
* Experiment with Find, Find All, Find and Replace. Also with Find in Project. Look at the find options.
* Lines vs. paragraphs in a text editor. Sort and remove duplicates.

## A few words about GitHub.
Git was developed as a distributed version control system for code. This means that it was possible to efficiently save and retrieve versions of a file. It also allows more than one person to edit a file or collection of files and and make sure that everyone's changes are saved and merged correctly. GitHub is a specific implementation of Git that adds project management capabilities to Git's file management. Increasingly, GitHub is used not only as a working code repository, but also for data. DH and other projects store their data in GitHub so that it can be updated and edited collaboratively, and so that older versions can be saved and retrieved. In addition, GitHub has a feature that can be used to generate web pages, and a variety of social features that allow the files stored in GitHub repositories to be shared, copied and improved by communities of coders or researchers. The website for this workshop was created using GitHub pages.
