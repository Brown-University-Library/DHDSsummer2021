# Introduction to the Atom Text Editor

## What is it?

A text editor is an application that can create and edit text files. Unlike Microsoft Word and other word processors, it doesn't support formatting such as bold, headings, footnotes and other layout features. Instead, it has features that facilitate writing code and manipulating text. You can use it to insert commands that will allow text to be formatted for example HTML tags or MarkDown, or to write programs. Atom also has the ability to clean and re-arrange text.

Atom can be used to create a customized and very sophisticated (and complex) environment for writing programs. For our purposes, however, we will focus on managing groups of files, exploring them and modifying them using regular expressions.

Atom is one of a several text editors used for writing programs. It was chosen because it is open source and runs on Windows, Mac OS and Linux, so everyone can work with the same software. Two other popular open source editors that run on all three operating systems are [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). All three have very similar capabilities.

## Working with Atom
* Install it by following the instructions in the [Atom documentation](https://flight-manual.atom.io/). Note that the documentation pages detect the type of computer you are using and provide appropriate instructions or keyboard shortcuts.
* Download [the zip archive with sample files](), and unzip it. Make sure to remove it from your Downloads folder before working with it. These are the files we will use to learn Atom.
* Open the Atom application by clicking on it. Check settings and packages. Install `sort-lines` and `duplicate-removal`. Note the tabs at the top of the window. Also the way files, settings open as side by side panes.
* Look at parenthesis matching and completion. HTML completion. Markdown highlighting. This may not be instantly useful, but it's the kind of thing that text editors are good at.
* Open a folder and to view it as a project.  Open one or more files.
* Experiment with Find, Find All, Find and Replace. Also with Find in all the files in a project. Look at the find options.

## A few words about GitHub.
Git and GitHub were developed as a distributed version control system for code. This means that it was possible to efficiently save and retrieve versions of a file, and also to have more than one person editing on a file or collection of files and to manage the files so that everyone's changes could be saved and merged. Increasingly, GitHub is used not only as a working code repository, but also for data—DH and other projects store their data in GitHub so that it can be updated and edited collaboratively, and so that older versions can be saved and retrieved. In addition, GitHub has a feature that can be used to generate web pages, and a variety of social features that allow the files stored in GitHub repositories to be shared, copied and improved by communities of coders or researchers.

We don't have time to learn about GitHub in this workshop, but it's an important tool both for storing files and for creating websites. The website for this workshop was written as plain text files using the Atom text editor, with embedded MarkDown codes to indicate formatting, and transformed into a website using GitHub pages.
