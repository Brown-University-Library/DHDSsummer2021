Dear Workshop Participants, 
The DH/DS workshop will be starting at 11am (Providence time) on Tuesday July 6 and we have planned a full and hopefully productive syllabus for the two week program. 
Before we begin, some questions, information and instructions, however. 

The Zoom link for all the sessions of the seminar will be the same: https://brown.zoom.us/j/93422456676

Please send your preferred email and name if it's not the same as your Brown address or the one this email has reached.

Note that if you upgrade to the latest version of Zoom, you can add your personal pronouns to your profile, if you'd like to. For more information, see the [instructions on the Zoom blog](https://blog.zoom.us/zoom-pronoun-sharing/).

The link to the syllabus: https://brown-university-library.github.io/DHDSsummer2021/syllabus.html

Please take a look at the Preparations page that is part of the syllabus before Tuesday.

See you all on Tuesday!
