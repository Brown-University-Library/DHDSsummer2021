# Preparations

## Zoom
All workshop sessions will be using the same Zoom link. Please check the email sent out Friday afternoon for the link.

## Shared Google folder
Participants will all be given access to the Google folder with some readings and handouts as well as sub folders for reading responses and project proposals.

## Brief Reading before Tuesday
If you have time, take a look at the two rubrics for evaluating Digital Humanities projects that are linked on the Tuesday, July 6 Syllabus page. We will be using them for the DH project evaluation exercise.
