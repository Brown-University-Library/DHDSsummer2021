CDS is offering an Introduction to Digital Humanities/Digital Scholarship summer workshop for graduate students in the Humanities and adjacent Social Sciences that will provide an introduction to a range of tools as well as the concepts that bolster digital work. In addition to a general introduction to a variety of  tools and methods, the workshop will include readings and discussion on the practice of Digital Humanities, topics like sustainability, data management, and documentation, and will provide an opportunity to explore the digital dimensions of participants’ research projects.

Participants who complete the course will

* be familiar with a variety of digital methods so they can apply them to their own work
* have discussed and evaluated existing digital humanities projects so they have examples of other work and have criteria for evaluation
* be familiar with DH as a disciplinary domain with a community of practitioners and published scholarship, so they can navigate existing publications and approaches
* be able to evaluate digital humanities projects and plan their own work effectively
* be aware of the ramifications of applying digital methods and working with digital cultural and historical data.

The course will be remote and partly asynchronous, and take place over two weeks, intended to correspond to an intensive full-week workshop. The synchronous component will take place three days a week from 11am-12:30 and 1:00 - 3:30pm (EDT). The asynchronous component will incorporate readings and videos and homework in which participants will practice the skills and tools that are presented in the face-to-face meetings. During the second week of the workshop, participants will prepare a small digital project and present it on the last day. There will also be opportunities for discussions arising out of participants’ interests.

This workshop is intended to encourage students/scholars to work digitally at the scale of effort that they might expend on their own projects. No prior knowledge or programming skills are required to participate; however, participants will be expected to engage with new software packages, learn to manipulate data in new ways, and learn programming concepts.

The workshop will be limited to 12 participants. Interested graduate students should fill out the application form. Applications received before May 15 will be given priority.  If spots remain open, applications will be accepted and evaluated on a rolling basis.

## Useful Information:

* May 15 Applications received by this date will receive priority.
* May 22: Notifications of acceptance first sent out
* Total effort anticipated for this workshop is 24 hours of synchronous class time, and about 12 hours of reading and homework.
