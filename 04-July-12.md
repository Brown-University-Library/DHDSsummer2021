## Homework
The Wednesday morning GIS workshop will follow Frank Donnelly's materials on [At These Coordinates](https://atcoordinates.info/qgis-tutorial/).
1. Read the laptop guidelines, which explain how and where to download QGIS
2. Download and install QGIS 3.16 Hannover, which is the long term release (*not* 3.20 which is the latest release)
3. Download and unzip the tutorial data
4. Download the tutorial manual and read pages 1-10

For the Visualization session, read [The science behind data visualisation](https://www.creativebloq.com/design/science-behind-data-visualisation-8135496) which gives a very high-level overview of perceptual approaches to visual representations. You can also take a quick peek at [Junk Charts Trifecta Checkup](https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/junk-charts-trifecta-checkup-the-definitive-guide.html) which is more of a communications take. Both approaches will be referenced in the session tomorrow.
